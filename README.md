# WatchDO
Watch the page on digitalocean.com that accepts submissions for freelance tutorials. At the moment, they're not accepting submissions. This is indicated by a certain div which has a 'disabled' class applied. When that class is no longer applied to that div, infer that DO is again accepting submissions, and send a message to notify me.
